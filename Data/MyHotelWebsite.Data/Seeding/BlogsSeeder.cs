Whether in process cooling or food handling, cooling systems with natural refrigerants are becoming increasingly important, protect the environment and require less energy consumption. With the intelligent telecommunication software of HACCP remote maintenance, all connected systems can be checked and controlled around the clock. With a local specialist company, we were able to combine everything from one source, from concept planning, carpentry, as well as refrigeration and air conditioning technology, and optimally implement our philosophy of R50, with love for the region and a sense of sustainability.",

                Content = "Sustainability is a major issue for many people today. Also we are of this opinion and would like to pay conscious attention to our nature and environment, and deal with it better. We have 4 tips for you so that you too can enjoy the snow in the Stubaital this winter during your holiday and at the same time have a good conscience in matters of environment and nature.\r\n1. The right area\r\nChoose a snow-sure area - as well as our Stubaital, because if you want to experience snow fun in harmony with nature, you should go on holiday where as much natural snow as possible and few snow cannons are used.\r\n2. Sustainable variety\r\nWhat activities can be undertaken in winter that do not change or negatively affect nature? We have the answer for you. Hiking in the snow and then tobogganing with the whole family or on snowshoes through the snow-covered landscape, you can discover nature from a completely different and above all sustainable side. Cross-country skiing and ski touring also offer an entertaining change.\r\n3. Sustainable arrival\r\nOne of the most popular means of arrival is our car, it is comfortable and especially for a winter holiday one always has some luggage. But have you ever thought about an environmentally friendly way to get there by public transport? - Nature will thank you for it! We are happy to pick you up with our shuttle from the train or bus station. With public transport you can get from A to Z, as well as to the ski areas, stress-free and comfortable.\r\n4. Sustainable and ecological accommodation\r\nTo preserve an intact nature also for our descendants is close to our heart. That is why we obtain 100% of the energy we need to run our nature hotel in Tyrol from Tiroler Wasserkraft AG with the aid of state-of-the-art technology (such as groundwater heat pumps, heat exchangers, waste heat utilisation or monitoring of consumption electricity). Thus, an unbeatable 95% of our energy requirements come from CO2-free, renewable and nuclear-free sources. Optimised waste separation is just as much a matter of course for us as the use of ecologically valuable materials. We use seasonal and regional products and traditional delicacies, which are produced within a radius of 50 kilometres around the hotel and are typical for this region. For these and many other reasons we have been awarded the coveted Austrian and European Ecolabel. Come and see for yourself!",
